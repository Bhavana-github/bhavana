474,"473,""At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr)."",
",1
475,"474,""I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure."",
",1
476,"475,It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.,
",0
477,"476,Works great!.,
",1
478,"477,Everything about this product is wrong.First,
",1
479,"478,I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.,

485,"484,Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is,
",1
486,"485,Never got it!!!!!,
",1
487,"486,THAT one didn't work either.,

",0
496,"495,""Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life."",
",1
497,"496,""But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product."",

",0
510,"509,""It has a great camera thats 2MP, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality."",
",1
511,"510,You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.,
